## 🚀 Overview

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a critical skill for every Data Scientist. It's the first and most important step to ensure the integrity of your data and the validity of your findings.

In this tutorial, we dive into a comprehensive analysis of historical SAT and ACT data from 2017 and 2018. We'll compare participation rates and performance across all U.S. states to uncover interesting trends.

By the end of this tutorial, you will:

  - 🧠 Understand how to examine and manipulate real-world datasets.
  - 📈 Gain insights into standardized testing disparities.
  - 🐍 Master core EDA techniques in Python.

> **Note**: This tutorial is perfect for Python programmers looking to sharpen their data handling, analysis, and visualization skills.

## ✅ Key Objectives

Our EDA process is broken down into four clear goals:

1.  **📄 Describe the Dataset**

      - Check dimensions (rows and columns)
      - Identify missing data
      - Verify data types
      - Get a quick preview of the data

2.  **🧹 Clean the Data**

      - Handle missing or corrupted values
      - Convert data to the correct types
      - Fix structural errors and incorrect values

3.  **📊 Visualize Distributions**

      - Create insightful bar charts
      - Plot histograms to see data spread
      - Use box plots to identify outliers

4.  **🔗 Analyze Correlations**

      - Build heatmaps to explore relationships between variables

## 🤔 Why EDA Matters: A Data-Driven Approach

Standardized testing in the U.S. is complex. State-level requirements create inherent biases in the data:

  - Some states mandate the **SAT**.
  - Others mandate the **ACT**.
  - Some require both or let students choose.

This variability significantly impacts participation rates and scores. A data-driven approach allows us to:

  - ✅ **Validate or challenge** existing research.
  - 💡 **Uncover hidden trends** and patterns.
  - 🔬 **Develop new, evidence-based** insights.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

Ready to dive in? All the code and data are available in the GitHub repository.

🔗 **GitHub Repository**: [SAT & ACT Analysis](https://github.com/cbratkovics/sat_act_analysis)

### Required Libraries

Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed. We recommend working in a **Jupyter Notebook** for the best experience.

```python
# Core libraries for data manipulation and analysis
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Libraries for data visualization
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```
