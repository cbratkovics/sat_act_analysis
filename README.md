## Overview
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is one of the most important skills that every Data Scientist must master. It is essential for ensuring the integrity of your gathered data and the validity of your analysis.

In this tutorial, we walk through a comprehensive exploratory analysis of historical SAT and ACT data, comparing participation and performance across U.S. states for the years 2017 and 2018. By the end of this tutorial, you will:

- Understand how to examine and manipulate real-world datasets.
- Gain insights into standardized testing disparities.
- Learn core EDA techniques in Python.

> **Note**: This tutorial is ideal for Python programmers looking to strengthen their data handling and visualization skills.

## Objectives

### Exploratory Data Analysis Goals
1. **Describe the dataset**:
   - Number of rows and columns
   - Missing data
   - Data types
   - Quick data preview

2. **Clean the data**:
   - Handle missing or corrupted data
   - Convert data types
   - Fix incorrect values

3. **Visualize distributions**:
   - Bar charts
   - Histograms
   - Box plots

4. **Analyze correlations**:
   - Use heat maps to explore variable relationships

## Why EDA Matters: A Data-Driven Approach
Standardized testing has long been a subject of controversy in the U.S. Due to state-level differences in testing requirements, the data is inherently biased:

- Some states mandate only the SAT.
- Others mandate only the ACT.
- Some require both or allow students to choose.

This variability impacts participation rates and performance metrics. A data-driven approach allows us to:

- Validate or challenge qualitative research.
- Uncover hidden trends.
- Develop new, evidence-based insights.

To follow along, download the notebook and datasets from the GitHub link above.

### Required Libraries
Before starting, make sure the following Python libraries are installed:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```

We recommend working in a Jupyter Notebook environment for maximum interactivity.
